# GausSN

Welcome to GausSN â€“ a package for fitting astronomical light curve data using Gaussian Processes, with specific functionality for fitting time-delays of multiply-imaged supernovae. This package was developed by Erin Hayes (@erinhay), with vital help from Stephen Thorp (@stevet40), Nikki Arendse (@Nikki1510), Matthew Grayling (@mattgrayling), Suhail Dhawan (@sdhawan21), and Kaisey Mandel (@CambridgeAstroStat).

For an introduction to how to use GausSN, see the getting_started.ipynb notebook in the ipynb folder!

Thanks to Vidhi Lalchand (@vr308), Ben Boyd (@benboyd97), and Sam Ward (@sam-m-ward) for helpful discussion and Christian Kirkham (@astrochristian) for testing the code.
