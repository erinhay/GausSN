# GausSN

Welcome to GausSN â€“ a package for fitting astronomical light curve data using Gaussian Processes with particular functionality for fitting strongly lensed transients and their time delays. This package was developed by Erin Hayes (@erinhay), with assistence from Dr. Stephen Thorp (@stevet40). Thanks also to Ben Boyd (@benboyd97) for helpful discussion and Christian Kirkham (@astrochristian) for testing the code.

For an introduction to how to use Gaussian Processes with GausSN, see the getting_started.ipynb notebook in the ipynb folder! If you're interested in fitting gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) or gravitationally lensed quasars, check out the fitting_glSN_example.ipynb and fitting_glQSO_example.ipynb notebooks in the ipynb folder.
