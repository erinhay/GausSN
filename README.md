# GausSN

Welcome to GausSN â€“ a package for fitting astronomical light curve data using Gaussian Processes, with specific functionality for fitting time-delays of multiply-imaged supernovae. This package was developed by Erin Hayes (@erinhay) and Stephen Thorp (@stevet40). If you find this code helpful to your work, please cite:

Thanks to Ben Boyd (@benboyd97) and Sam Ward (@sam-m-ward) for helpful discussion and Christian Kirkham (@astrochristian) for testing the code.
