# GausSN

Welcome to GausSN â€“ a package for fitting astronomical light curve data using Gaussian Processes. This package was developed by Erin Hayes (@erinhay), with assistence from Dr. Stephen Thorp (@stevet40). Thanks also to Ben Boyd (@benboyd97) for helpful discussion and Christian Kirkham (@astrochristian) for testing the code.

For an introduction to how to use GausSN, see the getting_started.ipynb notebook in the ipynb folder!
