# GausSN

Welcome to GausSN â€“ a package for fitting astronomical light curve data using Gaussian Processes, with specific functionality for fitting time-delays of multiply-imaged transients. This package was developed by Erin Hayes (@erinhay), with vital help from Stephen Thorp (@stevet40), Nikki Arendse (@Nikki1510), Matthew Grayling (@mattgrayling), Suhail Dhawan (@sdhawan21), and Kaisey Mandel (@CambridgeAstroStat). If you find this code helpful to your work, please cite:
